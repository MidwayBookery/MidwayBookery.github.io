        <h3>Zachary Montgomery</h3>
        <h4>Founder</h4>
        <p>I am an INTJ, programmer, reader, and writer. I also enjoy a myriad of other things, but among my hobbies the ones I have stated have stuck out the most. I appreciate any sort of puzzle or intellectual challenge, and always have a desire to create things, usually intellectual as well. I love reading and wanted to expand my tastes. I also love chatting with people who share my hobbies, and wanted to build up a community to talk with other people who enjoy reading!</p>

        <h3>Meggie Morris</h3>
        <h4>Co-Founder and Editor</h4>
        <p>Hello!! My name is Meggie Morris. I’m currently a junior at Midway High School. Some things I’m in involved in is Track and Field, Pals, Ap/dual enrollment, and youth group at Antioch community church. I’m super excited to meet everybody who wants to join the Bookery!! I hope this can be a fun experience for everyone! I will do my best to be at most meetings but due to my dedication to track and field, there might be occasional times where I might have to be gone for the hours we will meet. Other than that, I can’t wait to see what this year brings forth!!! :)</p>
